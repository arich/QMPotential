	<string name="StartText">This app displays a wavefunction traveling from
  left to right in blue and a potential it encounters in red. The energy level of the 
	    wavefunction is shown as the cyan line. In classical mechanics, when the energy level is 
	    lower than that of the potential (such as a hill), the particle would 
	    not be able to travel through the potential, a ball would roll up and back down the hill.
	    When particles are extremely small, they exhibit quantum (wavelike) behavior, and there is 
	    a certain probability, shown by the T coefficient to the top right, that the particle tunnels through
	    the potential. The R coefficient is the probability the particle will reflect off the potential. 
	    The waveform is calculated in real time through backwards integration. You can change
	    the energy level of the waveform with the blue slider, and the width of the potential with the red slider. 
	    Finally, check the menu to switch between Gaussian and uniform distribution potentials.
