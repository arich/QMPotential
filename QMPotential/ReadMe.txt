Quantum Tunnelling - Read Me
By Andrew Rich
Copyright (C) 2012 Andrew Rich

This Android app is made to demonstrate a specific quantum mechanics phenomenon: quantum tunnelling. By manipulating 
the energy level of an incoming particle and the width of a potential with sliders, the app backwards integrates to 
determine the particle's wavefunction as is tunnels through the wave, and calculates transmission and reflection 
coefficients to calculate the respective probability of each. The wavefunction of the particle is displayed in blue, 
the potential is plotted in red, and the transmission and reflection coefficients are displayed at the top of the screen.
